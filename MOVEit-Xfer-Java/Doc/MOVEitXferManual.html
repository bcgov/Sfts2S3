<h2>Overview<a name="overview"></a></h2>

<p>MOVEit Xfer ("/ex-fer/") is a command-line application which
securely transfers files between a MOVEit DMZ server
and a Microsoft Windows computer or any computer running Java 1.7 or higher.
&#160;
</p>

<p><img src="images_moveitxfer/layout.png"/></p>

<p>
Designed to mimic the interface of a standard command-line FTP client,
this utility provides an easy upgrade path from command-line FTP clients
working against an
insecure or firewall-adverse FTP system
to command-line MOVEit Xfer clients working with
a secure and firewall-friendly MOVEit DMZ system.
</p>

<p>MOVEit Xfer features:
<ul>
	<li>Single TCP port (HTTPS) file transfers</li>
	<li>On-the-fly data transmission compression to conserve bandwidth and speed transfers</li>
	<li>Cryptographic-quality file integrity checks to guard against truncation or corruption during transit</li>
	<li>Resuming of partial transfers</li>
	<li>Microsoft or Java SSL/TLS encryption libraries during transport</li>
	<li>MOVEit Crypto's FIPS-140-2 validated AES encryption during storage on a MOVEit DMZ server</li>
	<li>HTTP/S proxy server support</li>
	<li>USB-Friendly "Portable" deployment</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Like any other well-behaved command-line utility, MOVEit Xfer can be driven by an automated script
such as a Windows batch file or Unix shell script.
In turn, these scripts can be scheduled by Windows Scheduled Tasks
or Unix cron.
In other words, the open functionality of MOVEit Xfer
allows users to build an automated collection of
MOVEit DMZ transfer scripts with this utility.

<h2>Requirements<a name="requirements"></a></h2>

<p>On Windows, MOVEit Xfer is a standalone executable that does not require any other software,
assuming the operating system is Microsoft Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7, or 8.
On other operating systems, MOVEit Xfer requires Java 1.7 or higher.
</p>

<p>The Java version of MOVEit Xfer can also be run on Windows systems, but
it's usually not necessary, even for testing, because MOVEit Xfer accepts the same commands under
both native Windows and the Java runtime environment.
</p>

<p>All versions of MOVEit Xfer require the remote MOVEit DMZ server to be version 3.1.7 or higher.
(Version 3.1.7 was released in Nov. 2004.)</p>

<h2>Installation<a name="installation"></a></h2>

<h3>Windows Installation</h3>

<p>To install MOVEit Xfer, simply run the MOVEit Xfer for Windows installation package.  This package will ask into which folder and which "Start menu" program group you would like to install the application.  It will change your "PATH" variable to allow you to run MOVEit Xfer from any command prompt.  (You may be prompted to log off after the installation to allow this to occur.)  The installation will also install a "Start Menu" link to this documentation.</p>

<p>The MOVEit Xfer for Windows installation package is also available in "MSI" format to aid mass-deployments.</p>

<h3>Java Installation</h3>

<p>To "install" MOVEit Xfer under Java, simply extract the contents of the MOVEit Xfer for Java archive file into a directory.
To run MOVEit Xfer, you will either need to have a Java runtime executable in your command-line "executable path"
or explicitly provide a path to that executable in the command line.</p>

<p>It will probably be useful to use a short script or other helper to avoid
making a user type the full path to either MOVEit Xfer or the Java executable each time
he/she would like to use MOVEit Xfer.  Sample scripts for Windows and Unix platforms
to carry out this task
are provided in the MOVEit Xfer for Java package ("xfer.bat" and "xfer.sh").</p>




<h2>Command Line<a name="commandline"></a></h2>

<p>Use the following command syntax to run MOVEit Xfer:</p>

<p><tt>xfer</tt> [args] [hostname]</p>

<p>...where "args" consists of any (or none) of the following options:
</p>

<p>hostname is the domain name or numeric IP address of the MOVEit DMZ server. </p>

<p>If no hostname is given on the command line, MOVEit Xfer starts without a configured host.  In this case, you must issue an open command to connect to a MOVEit DMZ server.</p>

<h3>Return Codes</h3>

<p>The following integer values are returned by MOVEit Xfer based on how it exits.
<ul>
<li>0 : no error</li>
<li>1 : command line parameter syntax error</li>
<li>2 : command file does not exist</li>
<li>3 : error occurred during a DMZ function and -quiterror is specified. This is the error code returned if a file transfer fails while the -quiterror option is enabled</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Compatibility with MOVEit Freely and Microsoft's "ftp.exe" Client</h3>

<p>MOVEit Freely is a free, command-line FTP/SSL application also written and distributed by Ipswitch.
The command-line syntax for MOVEit Xfer was based on existing MOVEit Freely command-line syntax.
This uniformity allows people to convert most MOVEit Freely scripts to MOVEit Xfer scripts
simply by replacing "ftps" with "xfer".
</p>

<p>MOVEit Freely command-line syntax was itself based on the command-line syntax of Microsoft's non-secure ftp.exe client.
Once again, this uniformity allows people to convert many scripts based on "ftp.exe" to MOVEit Xfer scripts
simply by replacing "ftp" with "xfer".
</p>


<h2>Commands<a name="commands"></a></h2>
<p>Once MOVEit Xfer is started, it prompts for and reads single-line "FTP-style" commands.
The commands are read from the console, or from the script filename supplied by using the -s parameter.</p>

<p>If a command that has required parameters is entered without the parameters, MOVEit Xfer will prompt for the parameters.
</p>

<p>For many commands, to enter a parameter containing spaces,
you must enclose the parameter in double quotes.
For instance, to retrieve a file named My Document.txt,
you should say get "My Document.txt".</p>

<p>Legal commands are listed below.  Optional parameters are enclosed in brackets ([]).
If you are familiar with FTP command syntax, there should be few surprises, as
MOVEit Xfer's command syntax is entirely based on standard FTP command syntax.</p>

<p><b>about</b><br/>
Displays program information about MOVEit Xfer, the current version,
and information about the system it is running under.</p>

<p><b>cd <i>directory</i></b><br/>
Changes the working directory on the server.</p>

<p><b>close</b><br/>
Closes the connection to the server without exiting the program.</p>

<p><b>debug</b><br/>
Toggles debug mode, which prints extra information to the console.</p>

<p><b>delete <i>filename</i></b><br/>
Deletes a filename on the DMZ server.</p>

<p><b>dir <i>[filemask]</i></b><br/>
Gets a directory listing from the DMZ server.</p>

<p><b>exit</b><br/>
Closes any open connection and exits the program.</p>

<p><b>get <i>remotefilename [localfilename]</i></b><br/>
Retrieves a file.  If localfilename is not specified, the file will be saved to the local system as remotefilename.  You may put " around the filenames in order to include spaces in the names.</p>

<p><b>help</b><br/>
Displays the list of commands accepted by MOVEit Xfer.</p>

<p><b>lcd <i>directory</i></b><br/>
Changes the local directory.</p>

<p><b>ldir <i>[filemask]</i></b><br/>
Gets a directory listing from the local system.</p>

<p><b>lls <i>[filemask]</i></b><br/>
Gets a short-form directory listing from the local system (names only).</p>

<p><b>ls <i>[filemask]</i></b><br/>
Gets a short-form directory listing from the DMZ server (names only).</p>

<p><b>mdelete <i>remotefilemask</i></b><br/>
Deletes multiple files from the remote system.  If not in batch mode,
MOVEit Xfer prompts for whether to actually delete the file.
The response should be "y" to delete the file, "n" to not delete the file,
or "a" to delete the file and all others without asking again.</p>

<p><b>mget <i>remotefilemask</i></b><br/>
Retrieves multiple files from the remote system.
If not in batch mode, MOVEit Xfer prompts for whether to actually
download the file. The response should be "y" to download the file,
"n" to not download the file, or "a" to download the file and all
others without asking again.</p>

<p><b>mkdir <i>remotedirectory</i></b><br/>
Makes a directory on the remote system.</p>

<p><b>mput <i>localfilemask [comments]</i></b><br/>
Sends multiple files to the remote system.  If not in batch mode,
MOVEit Xfer prompts for whether to actually upload the file.
The response should be "y" to upload the file, "n" to not upload the file,
or "a" to upload the file and all others without asking again.
Comments should be surrounded by double-quotes (&quot;) if they contain spaces.</p>

<p><b>open <i>[http:// | https://]hostname[:port][scriptpath]</i></b><br/>
Sets the DMZ host to connect to. If the protocol prefix is not included,
a secure connection will be assumed. Otherwise, MOVEit Xfer will use a
secure connection for "https://" prefixes, and a non-secure connection for
"http://" prefixes. The default secure connection port is 443, and the
default non-secure connection port is 80. Either may be overridden by
designating the port to use. The scriptpath must be included if the target
DMZ application does not reside in the root of the host webserver.</p>

<p>Example open commands:
<ul>
    <li>open moveit.Ipswitch.com - Set the host to moveit.Ipswitch.com. A secure connection will be attempted using port 443 to the root directory of the webserver.</li>
    <li>open http://moveit.Ipswitch.com:8080 - Set the host to moveit.Ipswitch.com. A non-secure connection will be attempted using port 8080 to the root directory of the webserver.</li>
    <li>open https://www.Ipswitch.com/moveit/ - Set the host to www.Ipswitch.com. A secure connection will be attempted using port 443 to the /moveit/ directory of the webserver. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>pass <i>password</i></b><br/>
Sets the password to be used when connecting to the DMZ host.
This command should only be used in batch mode command files.</p>

<p><b>prompt</b><br/>
Toggles whether mget, mput, and mdelete prompt for each file.
</p>

<p><b>put <i>localfilename [remotefilename [comments]]</i></b><br/>
Sends a file to a remote DMZ server.  If remotefilename is not specified,
the name of the file on the remote  system will be the same as localfilename.
You may put " around the filenames in order to include spaces in the names.
Comments should also be surrounded by double-quotes (&quot;) if they contain spaces.</p>

<p><b>pwd</b><br/>
Displays the current directory on the remote DMZ system if connected,
as well as the current directory on the local system.</p>

<p><b>rename <i>oldfilename newfilename</i></b><br/>
Renames a file on the remote system.</p>

<p><b>rmdir <i>remotedirectory</i></b><br/>
Removes a directory on the remote system.</p>

<p><b>user <i>[username [password]]</i></b><br/>
Sets the username and password to be used when connecting to the DMZ host.
If no password is provided and the program is not in batch mode,
MOVEit Xfer will prompt for a password.
If neither the username or the password are provided and the program is not
in batch mode, MOVEit Xfer will prompt for both the username and the password.</p>

<h2>Examples<a name="examples"></a></h2>

<h3>Simple Script Example</h3>

<p>The following script and command line retrieve all files named *.rpt
from the Incoming directory of a DMZ server.
The command line is:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>xfer -s:GetRpt.in moveit.bigcorp.com</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>The contents of GetRpt.in are:</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>
jsmith
secret123
cd Incoming
mget *.rpt
quit
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<p>Note that the lines in the script are simply the lines of text that would be entered by the user if the transfer were done interactively rather than via a script. Also note that the script did NOT need to include the "Y" or "N" responses a user would normally see if typing in an "mget" or "mput" command manually; during batch mode, xfer assumes the answer to these questions would be "Y."</p>

<h3>Simple Batch File to Upload a Single File</h3>

<p>The following batch file lets a user upload a single file using a single command.
If you save the following snippet as "uploadit.bat", usage would be:
"uploadit (hostname) (username) (password) (file_to_transfer)"</p>

<p><blockquote><pre>
echo put %4 &gt; temp.txt
echo quit &gt;&gt; temp.txt
xfer -user:%2 -password:%3 -s:temp.txt %1
del temp.txt
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<h2><a name='BatchFilethatChecksforErrors'>Batch File that Checks for Errors</a></h2>

<p>This batch file checks the exit code from MOVEit Xfer to see if any errors occurred.&#160; The
-quiterror parameter will make the program exit as soon as there is an error without reading any more
commands from the script file.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<pre>xfer -user:dave -password:super -quiterror -s:script.txt moveit.bigcorp.com
if %ERRORLEVEL%==0 goto great
echo MOVEit Xfer returned error code: %ERRORLEVEL%
if %ERRORLEVEL%==3 goto out
if %ERRORLEVEL% GEQ 1 goto oops
echo Unknown File Transfer Problem
goto done
:oops
echo Error in File Transfer syntax
goto done
:out
echo An error occurred in the File Transfer
goto done
:great
echo The File Transfer completed successfully
:done
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>




<h2>Distribution<a name="distribution"></a></h2>

<h3>Distribution Under Windows</h3>

<p>Under Windows, the standard MOVEit Xfer for Windows
installation packages will automatically
set the "PATH" variable to include the folder into which MOVEit Xfer was
installed.  This allows users to invoke the MOVEit Xfer client
from any command line prompt.  You should use the standard MOVEit Xfer for Windows
installation packages for distribution if your clients:
<ul>
  <li>are using Windows, AND...</li>
  <li>will write their own scripts OR are replacing existing FTP client scripts.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are "MSI" and "EXE" versions of the MOVEit Xfer for Windows installation packages.
In most cases you should use the "EXE" version as upgrading MSI packages can
require end users to perform some extra steps.  If you need to support
Windows 98 or want to <a href="#rollyourown">roll your own distribution</a>, you may want to
use the basic archive file (in "zip" format) instead.
</p>

<h3>Distribution Under Java</h3>

<p>Under Java, the standard MOVEit Xfer for Java package
is an archive file (in "zip" and "tar.gz" format)
that contains the MOVEit Xfer software and documentation.
You should the standard MOVEit Xfer for Java
archive package for distribution if your clients:
<ul>
  <li>are using Java, AND...</li>
  <li>will write their own scripts or are replacing existing FTP client scripts.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="rollyourown">USB-Friendly "Portable" Deployment</a></h3>

<p><i>"A portable app is a computer program that you can carry around with you on a
portable device and use on any Windows computer. When your USB thumbdrive,
portable hard drive, iPod or other portable device is plugged in, you have
access to your software and personal data just as you would on your own PC.
And when you unplug, none of your personal data is left behind."</i>
(Rare Ideas, LLC, 2005)</p>

<p>MOVEit Xfer can be deployed/installed as a USB-Friendly "Portable" application.
Simply copy the contents of a MOVEit Xfer archive file (e.g., "MOVEitXfer.zip")
into a folder on your USB drive or other portable device.
</p>

<p>With command line
      applications, MOVEit Xfer included, your personal information is
      generally confined to what you have written in batch files or piped out
      into log files.  Please remember to keep any such batch or log files on
      the portable drive too.</p>

<p>
You may wish to add the portable directory in which you installed MOVEit Xfer
to your PATH if you want to be able to invoke MOVEit Xfer from any folder
without specifying a full path to the executable.  If you often find yourself
running command-line applications in a portable environment, you will also
probably want to create a portable "Launch Command Line" shortcut and/or batch
file on your portable device so your favorite utilities are always available
in command-line sessions.
</p>

<h3><a name="rollyourown">Custom Distribution</a></h3>

<p>If you elect to roll your own distribution of MOVEit Xfer, you MUST include:
  <ul>
    <li>THIS DOCUMENT (or at least the LICENSE section of this document), AND...</li>
    <li>xfer.exe (for Windows clients), AND/OR...</li>
    <li>xfer.jar (for Java clients)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>You will also probably want to include any custom batch files, script input files and/or documentation
in your own distribution.  Usually all these files are placed into a single "archive"
file (e.g., a "zip" file), but they may be bundled in other distributions
as permitted by the license found in this document.</p>



<h2><a name="othermoveitproducts">Other MOVEit Products</a></h2>

<h3><a name="othermoveitproducts_ez">Need more desktop automation?</a></h3>

<p>You can automate MOVEit Xfer by running a batch file to power it from the operating system's scheduler.
However, if you would like to provide a "friendlier" automated client to your Windows users, you may want to examine <b>MOVEit EZ</b>.
The MOVEit EZ client runs as an icon in your Windows system tray and automatically moves files back and forth between a local filesystem and a MOVEit DMZ server, and includes features MOVEit Xfer does not have such as automatic retry, logging and a GUI configuration interface.
(<a href="http://www.ipswitchft.com/moveitez" target="_blank">More info...</a>)</p>

<h3><a name="othermoveitproducts_central">Need MISSION-CRITICAL automation?</a></h3>

<p>If you run more than 10 automated MOVEit Xfer transfers or need mission-critical automated file-transfer,
please consider using <b>MOVEit Central</b> instead of MOVEit Xfer.
MOVEit Central is a fully-automated, schedule and event driven file transfer engine.
It can move files between FTP servers, SSH servers, Windows file shares, email servers and comes with enterprise features such as remote control, task configuration/execution delegation, and automatic retry/resume of failed transfers.
(<a href="http://www.ipswitchft.com/moveitcentral" target="_blank">More info...</a>)</p>

<h3><a name="othermoveitproducts_dmz">Need your own secure file transfer server?</a></h3>

<p>The first Windows-based secure file transfer server to support all three modes of FTP over SSL, the first to add SSH support, and the first one to support both protocols plus browser-based (HTTPS) transfers was <b>MOVEit DMZ</b>. In addition to three secure IN TRANSIT protocols, MOVEit DMZ features integrated FIPS-140-validated AT REST encryption to protect files while they are stored on the server. Request an evalution and join the banks, governments, hospitals and others who have stepped up to MOVEit secure file transfer today!
